# ChangeRole

The base code is generated from [Yeoman azuresfcsharp](https://github.com/microsoft/generator-azuresfcsharp), but update to `net6`
The code is very simple, just print the current role when role changed trigger by service fabric
The Dockerfile put everything together and starts stateful app with primary role in a container.
